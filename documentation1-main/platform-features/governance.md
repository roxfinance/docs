# Governance

Governance is at the heart of ROX Finance, empowering the community to make key decisions about the platformâ€™s future. This feature, planned for launch in **Q2 2025**, will allow ROX token holders to actively participate in the platform's direction through the ROX DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

***

**How Governance Works:**

1. **Proposal Submission:**
   * Any eligible ROX token holder can submit proposals to the community for consideration.
2. **Voting Mechanism:**
   * Token holders vote on proposals using their staked ROX tokens, with voting power proportional to the amount staked.
3. **Implementation:**
   * Approved proposals are executed via smart contracts, ensuring transparency and trust.

***

**Examples of Governance Decisions:**

* Approving new real-world assets for tokenization.
* Adjusting staking reward rates or pool sizes.
* Introducing new platform features or partnerships.

***

**Key Benefits of Governance:**

* **Community Ownership:**
  * Gives ROX token holders a direct voice in platform decisions.
* **Transparency:**
  * All proposals, votes, and outcomes are publicly visible on the blockchain.
* **Incentives for Participation:**
  * Active participants may earn governance rewards for voting and engaging in the decision-making process.

***

**Planned Launch Timeline:**

* **Q2 2025:** Governance features go live, enabling DAO operations and voting.
