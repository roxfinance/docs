# Real Asset Tokenization

ROX Finance brings the power of blockchain to real-world assets, enabling fractional ownership, global access, and seamless trading. The tokenization of assets like real estate, gold, and stocks is planned for **Q2 2025**, with continuous expansion throughout the year.

***

**How Asset Tokenization Works:**

1. **Asset Submission:**
   * Owners submit assets for tokenization, providing necessary documentation and details.
2. **Community Approval:**
   * The ROX DAO reviews and votes on submitted assets to ensure legitimacy and value.
3. **Token Creation:**
   * Approved assets are converted into blockchain-based tokens, representing fractional ownership.
4. **Trading and Investing:**
   * Investors can buy, sell, and trade these tokens on the ROX Finance platform.

***

**Benefits of Tokenization:**

* **Fractional Ownership:**
  * Invest in a portion of high-value assets instead of purchasing the entire asset.
* **Global Accessibility:**
  * Participate in asset trading from anywhere in the world without intermediaries.
* **Increased Liquidity:**
  * Unlock liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets like real estate and gold.
* **Transparency:**
  * Asset ownership is secured and verified on the blockchain.

**Example Use Case:**\
&#xNAN;_"An investor in Asia can own a fraction of a New York skyscraper, a gold reserve in Africa, or shares in a multinational company, all through the ROX platform."_

**Planned Launch Timeline:**

* **Q2 2025:** Tokenization launches with initial assets, expanding to more categories throughout the year
