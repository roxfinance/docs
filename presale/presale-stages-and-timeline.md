**Why Act Early?**

* **Maximize Value:** Secure ROX tokens at lower prices before the price rises.
* **Daily Price Increases:** Each day brings a $0.01 price incrementâ€”investing early saves significantly.
* **Limited Supply Per Stage:** Once tokens for a stage are sold out, the price moves to the next stage.
