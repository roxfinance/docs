# Audit Report

**Project Name:** Rox Finance\
**Contract Name:** Rox\
**Audit Date:** 30 January 2025\
**Audited By:** Rox Security Team

***

## **Introduction**

The Rox Token is an ERC-20 compliant token designed with enhanced functionality, including:

1. A configurable transaction fee mechanism.
2. Fee distribution among multiple recipients based on basis points.
3. Minting and burning capabilities, allowing the owner to control token supply.
4. Ownership-based access control for administrative tasks.

This audit evaluates the correctness, security, and efficiency of the smart contract.

***

## **Scope of Audit**

The scope of this audit includes:

* **Code Analysis:** Reviewing the implementation for logical and functional correctness.
* **Security Assessment:** Identifying vulnerabilities in the contract.
* **Gas Efficiency:** Evaluating the efficiency of functions.
* **Compliance:** Verifying compliance with the ERC-20 standard.

### **Files Audited**

* `RoxToken.sol` (Rox Token Contract)

***

## **Summary of Findings**

| **Category**            | **Status**         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Overall Security**    | ✅ Passed           |
| **Code Quality**        | ✅ High Quality     |
| **Gas Optimization**    | ✅ Efficient        |
| **Standard Compliance** | ✅ ERC-20 Compliant |
| **Documentation**       | ✅ Well-Documented  |

***

## **Detailed Findings**

### **1. General Implementation**

The contract follows the ERC-20 standard and extends functionality using:

* **ERC20Burnable:** Allows token holders to burn their tokens.
* **Ownable:** Provides ownership-based administrative control.

**Key Functions Implemented:**

* `mint`: Allows the owner to mint tokens.
* `transfer` & `transferFrom`: Includes a fee distribution mechanism.
* `setFeeBasisPoints` & `setFeeRecipient`: Enables the owner to configure fee parameters.

**Finding:** The implementation adheres to best practices.

***

### **2. Security Review**

#### **Access Control**

* Functions like `mint`, `setFeeBasisPoints`, and `setFeeRecipient` are restricted to the owner.
* Ownership is managed using OpenZeppelin’s `Ownable` module.

**Finding:** No unauthorized access vulnerabilities identified.

#### **Fee Distribution Mechanism**

* The fee is calculated and distributed among configured recipients.
* Ensures that the sum of recipient basis points does not exceed 100% (10,000 basis points).

**Finding:** Secure and correctly implemented.

#### **Token Transfers**

* Tokens are transferable while deducting fees if applicable.
* Proper checks ensure fees and remaining amounts are handled accurately.

**Finding:** Passed all security tests.

***

### **3. Gas Optimization**

The contract is designed with gas efficiency in mind:

* Looping over fee recipients is optimized with checks to prevent unnecessary iterations.
* Fee calculations leverage basis points for accuracy and simplicity.

**Recommendation:** While the fee distribution mechanism is efficient, it is recommended to limit the number of fee recipients to prevent high gas costs in edge cases.

***

### **4. Compliance**

The contract is fully compliant with the ERC-20 standard:

* Implements `decimals`, `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, and `transferFrom` as required.
* Adheres to OpenZeppelin’s widely trusted implementations for ERC-20 functionality.

**Finding:** Fully compliant.

***

## **Tests Performed**

| **Test Category**       | **Test Case**                                          | **Status** |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| **Basic Functionality** | Token minting, burning, and transferring               | ✅ Passed   |
| **Fee Mechanism**       | Fee calculation and distribution                       | ✅ Passed   |
| **Access Control**      | Restriction of sensitive functions to owner            | ✅ Passed   |
| **Edge Cases**          | Handling of 0-value transfers and excessive recipients | ✅ Passed   |
| **Reentrancy**          | Attempted reentrancy attacks                           | ✅ Passed   |
| **Overflow/Underflow**  | Checked for arithmetic vulnerabilities                 | ✅ Passed   |

***

## **Recommendations**

1. **Limit Fee Recipients:** While the contract ensures efficient fee distribution, limiting the number of fee recipients can reduce potential gas costs in edge cases.
2. **Future Updates:** Consider integrating upgradeable patterns for enhanced flexibility in future updates.
3. **Security Audit Re-Runs:** Reassess the contract after any modifications or updates to ensure continued security compliance.

***

## **Conclusion**

The Rox Token contract is secure, efficient, and compliant with the ERC-20 standard. It incorporates a robust fee mechanism and follows best practices in smart contract development. The code is well-documented and ready for deployment.

### **Final Rating:**
