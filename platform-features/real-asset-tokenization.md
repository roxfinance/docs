# Real Asset Tokenization

ROX Finance brings the power of blockchain to real-world assets, enabling fractional ownership, global access, and seamless trading. The tokenization of assets like real estate, gold, and stocks is planned for **Q2 2025**, with continuous expansion throughout the year.

***

#### How Asset Tokenization Works

* **Asset Submission:** Owners submit assets for tokenization, providing necessary documentation and details.
* **Community Approval:** The ROX DAO reviews and votes on submitted assets to ensure legitimacy and value.
* **Token Creation:** Approved assets are converted into blockchain-based tokens, representing fractional ownership.
* **Trading and Investing:** Investors can buy, sell, and trade these tokens on the ROX Finance platform.

***

#### Benefits of Tokenization

* **Fractional Ownership:** Invest in a portion of high-value assets instead of purchasing the entire asset.
* **Global Accessibility:** Participate in asset trading from anywhere in the world without intermediaries.
* **Increased Liquidity:** Unlock liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets like real estate and gold.
* **Transparency:** Asset ownership is secured and verified on the blockchain.

***

#### Example Use Case

An investor in Asia can own a fraction of a New York skyscraper, a gold reserve in Africa, or shares in a multinational company—all through the ROX platform.

***

#### Planned Launch Timeline

* **Q2 2025:** Tokenization launches with initial assets, expanding to more categories throughout the year.

By leveraging blockchain technology, ROX Finance democratizes access to high-value assets, fostering a more inclusive and transparent financial ecosystem.
