# Governance

Governance is at the heart of ROX Finance, empowering the community to make key decisions about the platform’s future. Through the ROX DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), ROX token holders will have the opportunity to actively participate in shaping the platform’s direction. This feature is planned for launch in **Q2 2025**.

***

#### How Governance Works

* **Stake ROX Tokens:** Token holders must stake their ROX tokens to receive **ROXGov tokens**, which are used for governance participation.
* **Proposal Submission:** Any eligible holder of ROXGov tokens can submit proposals to the community for consideration.
* **Voting Mechanism:** Vote on proposals using ROXGov tokens, with voting power proportional to the amount staked.
* **Implementation:** Approved proposals are executed via smart contracts, ensuring transparency and trust.

***

#### Examples of Governance Decisions

* Approving new real-world assets for tokenization.
* Adjusting staking reward rates or pool sizes.
* Introducing new platform features or partnerships.

***

#### Key Benefits of Governance

* **Community Ownership:** Gives ROX token holders a direct voice in platform decisions.
* **Transparency:** All proposals, votes, and outcomes are publicly visible on the blockchain.
* **Incentives for Participation:** Active participants may earn governance rewards for voting and engaging in the decision-making process.

#### Planned Launch Timeline

* **Q2 2025:** Governance features go live, enabling DAO operations and voting.

By empowering token holders with decision-making authority, ROX Finance ensures a decentralized, transparent, and community-driven platform that aligns with the principles of blockchain technology.
